## Overview

This lesson consists of three parts. First, it provides an overview of geospatial analytics. Second, it explains the popular geospatial models used to store geographical data.  The methods used to import, integrate, wrangle, process geospatial data will be discussed too.  Lastly, the basic principles and concepts of thematic mapping and geovisualisation will be introduced.   

The hands-on exercises will allow you to gaion hands-on experience on using:

- [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package to import and wrangle vector-based data,
- [**terra**](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html) package to import and wrangle raster-based data, and
- [**tmap**](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) package to build cartographic quality thematic maps.
